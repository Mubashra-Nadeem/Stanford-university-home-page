This project involves creating a fully functional replica of the Stanford University homepage using HTML and CSS. The focus was on accurately reproducing the layout, design, and key features of the original website, including the header with navigation, a visually appealing hero section, academic and research highlights, and a comprehensive footer. The project emphasizes responsive design principles to ensure compatibility across various devices and screen sizes. This replica serves as a practical demonstration of web development skills, including the use of semantic HTML, CSS styling, and media queries for responsiveness.
